## üí° What This Is

The Apple Podcasts app on macOS stores episode transcripts locally, but doesn‚Äôt offer a way to export or bulk copy them. This tool allows you to easily extract them.

You can us it to:

* View transcripts in full, in a readable format
* Select episodes and download them as `.txt` files
* Batch-download transcripts in a ZIP file
* Optionally include metadata like title, author, date, and description

All processing happens locally in your browser. It does not upload or share any data externally. To confirm you can disable the internet after website is loaded.¬†¬†

1. **Make sure transcripts are saved on your Mac**

## üíª Where Does This Come From?

The data is locally stored in `~/Library/Group Containers/243LU875E5.groups.com.apple.podcasts/Library/Cache/Assets/TTML`. The tool also pulls in the `.sqlite` folder to display additional information about the podcast to make it easier to find the one you're looking for.
